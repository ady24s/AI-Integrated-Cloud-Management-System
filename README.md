AI-Driven Cloud Resource Management and Security Dashboard

Project Overview
This project is a platform-independent, AI-driven dashboard designed to optimize cloud resource usage and enhance security for organizations using cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

The system helps address key challenges organizations face:
    1. Idle Resource Management: Detect and notify about unused or underutilized cloud resources.
    2. Cost Optimization: Provide actionable insights to minimize unnecessary operational costs.
    3. Security Enhancements: Detect anomalies and recommend measures to secure sensitive data.
    4. Real-Time Monitoring: Track and manage cloud resources across multiple platforms in one unified dashboard.

Key Features:
    • Multi-Cloud Integration: Seamlessly connect to AWS, Azure, and GCP to fetch resource usage data.
    • AI/ML-Powered Insights: Predict demand spikes and detect idle or underutilized resources using AI models.
    • Proactive Notifications: Send email or SMS alerts to users when action is required, like shutting down idle instances.
    • Enhanced Security: Implement anomaly detection for unauthorized access or unusual activity.
    • Real-Time Dashboard: Unified view of all cloud resources with interactive graphs and insights.

Technology Stack:
    • Backend: FastAPI (Python), Uvicorn (ASGI server).
    • Cloud Integration: AWS SDK (Boto3), Azure SDK, Google Cloud SDK.
    • AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn for predictive analysis.
    • Frontend: React.js (to be implemented).
    • Notifications: SMTP for email, Twilio for SMS alerts.
    • Database (optional): PostgreSQL/MongoDB for storing resource data
